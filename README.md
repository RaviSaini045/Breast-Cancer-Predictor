# Breast-Cancer-Predictor
Breast cancer tumor datasets were taken and using supervised learning and algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-NN, and Naive Bayes, this project analyzes breast cancer tumor datasets to predict the initial or final stage of cancer. By leveraging this approach, the detection time is drastically reduced from the typical 10+ days in regular diagnosis to just minutes, offering a significant advantage in timely detection.

The dataset selected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayaadithyanvg/breast-cancer-prediction?resource=download) focuses on identifying breast cancer, where abnormal cell growth leads to tumor formation in the breast. These tumors can either be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

The machine learning model employed, Logistic Regression, specializes in binary classification problems. In the context of breast cancer prediction, it distinguishes between benign ('B') and malignant ('M') tumors. This model uses various input features to predict whether a breast tumor falls under the category of benign (confined to a specific tissue) or malignant (capable of spreading to other tissues, posing greater risks).

# Feasibility and Applicability: 
# Usability: 
This predictor can be used by different healthcare organizations.This project can improve the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis by analyzing large amounts of patient data and identifying patterns that may be missed by human doctors. This can potentially lead to earlier detection, better treatment outcomes, and ultimately, saving lives
 
# Specify Features: 
This project is made to make life simpler as normal diagnosis takes about 10+ days to detect the tumor, where this project comes as a blessing and the tumor could be detected in minutes.
 
# Scalability: 
A total of 108,112 women received breast health education; 48% visited the health facilities for clinical breast examination (CBE), 3% had a positive CBE result, and 41% were referred to a diagnostic facility. The concordance of CBE findings between health care providers and adherence to follow-up care improved considerably, with more women visiting the diagnostic facilities and completing diagnostic evaluation within 1 month from initial screening, and with only 9% lost to follow-up. 
The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing a large-scale, decentralized breast cancer early detection program delivered through the existing primary health care system in India.
 
# How Realistic to Achieve/Make: 
Afshar et al. studied the survival of breast cancer patients using a dataset with 856 records and 15 clinical features using machine learning models. In this study, it showed the highest sensitivity (92.21%) and accuracy (84%).

# Economic Sustainability: 
The economic cost of making a breast cancer predictor by machine learning can vary significantly depending on several factors. The development of a predictive model requires the acquisition and processing of high-quality data, access to adequate computing resources, and the involvement of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and medical professionals with specialized knowledge and skills. The costs can range from a few thousand to several hundred thousand dollars. However, the potential benefits of such a predictor in terms of early detection and improved treatment outcomes can justify the costs. Early detection of breast cancer can lead to better outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and improved quality of life for patients, making the investment worthwhile.

# Environment Sustainability: 
It is unclear what is meant by "Environmental sustainability for Breast cancer predictor by machine learning." However, I will attempt to provide an answer based on my understanding of the topic.
To develop an environmental sustainability breast cancer predictor using machine learning, one would need to gather data on various environmental factors that may contribute to the development of breast cancer, such as air pollution, exposure to toxins, diet, and physical activity. The data would also need to include information on individuals' genetic and demographic factors, such as age, sex, and family history of breast cancer.
Overall, the development of an environmental sustainability breast cancer predictor by machine learning has the potential to improve our understanding of the complex interplay between environmental factors and breast cancer risk and ultimately help reduce the incidence of this disease.
 
# Any Threat/Risk/Problem that can be foreseen? 
Developing a breast cancer predictor using machine learning may involve several risks and challenges, such as ensuring the quality of data, addressing privacy concerns, complying with regulatory requirements, navigating government involvement, addressing ethical considerations, and ensuring adoption by healthcare providers. These risks can be mitigated through careful planning, attention to detail, and collaboration between stakeholders.
           
# Any Improvement in the project that can be foreseen to implement in future?
Machine learning can improve breast cancer prediction by analyzing large amounts of patient data to identify patterns and predict the likelihood of developing breast cancer. This can help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients earlier, improve personalized treatment planning, and reduce unnecessary interventions, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.
